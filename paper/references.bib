    abstract = {The scientiﬁc literature is replete with data describing novel porous structures, making the selection of an adsorbent for storage and separation applications a diﬃcult task, and often leading to overlooked materials. In this study, we use a high-throughput methodology to process a dataset of 32 000 adsorption isotherms from the {NIST} adsorption database ({ISODB}) and generate key performance indicators applicable to binary separation on 4400 hosts and 49 guests, with the aim of simplifying the aforementioned choice. The procedure is validated against an internal dataset to gauge the suitability of the derived indicators. The results are then collated in a powerful online dashboard, which can be used to explore material−adsorbate pairs. Finally, we use this toolchain to scrutinize several challenging and industrially relevant case studies and highlight materials that may be promising for further analysis.},

    title = {Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Simulation of Hydrogen Adsorption in Different Carbon Nano Structures},
    abstract = {Grand Canonical Monte Carlo ({GCMC}) simulations are performed to study hydrogen physisorption in different nano carbon porous materials made up of different substructures including carbon nanotubes ({CNT}), graphene sheets and C60. Hydrogen weight percentage (wt\%) at different temperatures with pressure ranging from 1 to 20MPa are predicted. Fugacity and quantum effects on hydrogen adsorption are investigated. Different structural dimensions including the sizes of the substructures and spacing between the substructures are used to study the geometrical effects on hydrogen storage capacity in carbon materials. The calculated results generally agree well with available data from other calculations. It is concluded that {CNT} arrays, graphite nanofibers ({GNF}) and C60 intercalated graphite ({CIG}) are not promising to reach the {DOE} 6.5 wt\% target at room temperature. It is also found that the quantum effect is significant in low temperature hydrogen adsorption and different treatments to account for the quantum effect also influence the predicted wt\% differently.},

    abstract = {The cryogenic separation of noble gases is energy-intensive and expensive, especially when low concentrations are involved. Metal−organic frameworks ({MOFs}) containing polarizing groups within their pore spaces are predicted to be eﬃcient Xe/Kr solid-state adsorbents, but no experimental insights into the nature of the Xe−network interaction are available to date. Here we report a new microporous {MOF} (designated {SBMOF}-2) that is selective toward Xe over Kr under ambient conditions, with a Xe/Kr selectivity of about 10 and a Xe capacity of 27.07 wt \% at 298 K. Single-crystal diﬀraction results show that the Xe selectivity may be attributed to the speciﬁc geometry of the pores, forming cages built with phenyl rings and enriched with polar −{OH} groups, both of which serve as strong adsorption sites for polarizable Xe gas. The Xe/Kr separation in {SBMOF}-2 was investigated with experimental and computational breakthrough methods. These experiments showed that Kr broke through the column ﬁrst, followed by Xe, which conﬁrmed that {SBMOF}-2 has a real practical potential for separating Xe from Kr. Calculations showed that the capacity and adsorption selectivity of {SBMOF}-2 are comparable to those of the best-performing unmodiﬁed {MOFs} such as {NiMOF}-74 or Co formate.},

    abstract = {Nanoporous materials ({NPMs}) selectively adsorb and concentrate gases into their pores, and thus could be used to store, capture, and sense many different gases. Modularly synthesized classes of {NPMs}, such as covalent organic frameworks ({COFs}), offer a large number of candidate structures for each adsorption task. A complete {NPM}-property table, containing measurements of the relevant adsorption properties in the candidate {NPMs}, would enable the matching of {NPMs} with adsorption tasks. However, in practice the {NPM}-property matrix is only partially observed (incomplete); (i) many properties of any given {NPM} have not been measured and (ii) any given property has not been measured for all {NPMs}.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}The idea in this work is to leverage the observed ({NPM}, property) values to impute the missing ones. Similarly, commercial recommendation systems impute missing entries in an incomplete item-customer ratings matrix to recommend items to customers. We demonstrate a {COF} recommendation system to match {COFs} with adsorption tasks by training a low rank model of an incomplete {COF}--adsorption-property matrix. A low rank model, trained on the observed ({COF}, adsorption property) values, provides (i) predictions of the missing ({COF}, adsorption property) values and (ii) a "map" of {COFs}, represented as points, wherein {COFs} with similar (dissimilar) adsorption properties congregate (separate). We find the performance of the {COF} recommendation system varies for different adsorption tasks and diminishes precipitously when the fraction of missing entries exceeds 60\%. The concepts in our {COF} recommendation system can be applied broadly to many different materials and properties. {\textless}br{\textgreater}},
